# Cryptocurrencies Project

The purpose of this project was to leverage unsupervised machine learning in order to cluster cryptocurrency data and to create a classification system based on various attributes of the currencies (including the total amoumt mined, total supply of the currency, its algorithm, etc.).

This was accomplished in four steps:

- First, the data had to be pre-processed and transformed in order to facilitate the use of the algorithm;
- Next, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the dataset into three components;
- Subsequently, the data was fed through the K_Means algorithm in order to cluster the data into specific groups, and the results were visualized in a 3D scatterplot;
- Lastly, we created additional visualizations (i.e. table and 2D scatterplot) to aid in the analysis.
